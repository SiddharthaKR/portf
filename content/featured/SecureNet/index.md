Developed "SecureNet," a Kotlin-based Android app aimed at mobile security. Key achievements include:
Multi-Layered Threat Detection: Implemented static and dynamic analysis for comprehensive protection. Static analysis checked app permissions, while dynamic analysis monitored network activity.
Utilizing Security Tools: Integrated MobSF for analyzing APKs and identifying malicious signatures.
User-Friendly Reporting: Created FastAPI-based APIs to generate concise reports using Google Gemini for summarization. SecureNet also provided actionable suggestions based on these reports.
