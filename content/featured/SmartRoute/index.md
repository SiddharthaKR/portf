This project focused on optimizing last-mile delivery operations using a React.js application. I implemented
Delivery Route Optimization: where a custom algorithm using Python to efficiently group delivery orders into optimized tours, minimizing travel time and distance.
Seamless Navigation: Integrated a navigation system to guide riders along the optimized routes, ensuring efficient completion of deliveries.
Dynamic Pickup Management: Implemented a flexible system allowing riders to dynamically add or remove pickup points during their delivery tours, catering to unforeseen changes.
