Currently a final year student at IIT Guwahati on a mission to unlock the potential of technology for real-world problems.

My passion lies at the intersection of software development and hardware design. I've tackled network traffic analysis with Verilog at NTT Advanced Technologies (Japan) and built secure Android apps (SecureNet!) using Kotlin. My internship at BYJU'S honed my full-stack development skills, crafting a virtual classroom experience for 250,000+ students.

Here's what gets me excited:

Turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.
Learning new languages (both human and programming ones!). Ô∏è
Collaborating with passionate teams to build something meaningful.
**Looking to connect with folks who share the thrill of innovation! **

Feel free to reach out if:

You're working on a cool project and need a teammate.
You have some killer career advice to share.
You just want to chat about the future of tech!

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
